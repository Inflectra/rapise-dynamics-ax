# Overview

The framework consists of two separate parts.

- `DesktopClient` contains reusable functions and sample tests for Dynamics AX 2012 desktop client.
- `EnterprisePortal` contains reusable functions and sample tests for Enterprise Portal.

DaxFramework test is the top level container and must be pushed to SpiraTest first (before assigning test cases).

Navigate to `DesktopClient` and `EnterprisePortal` to get more information.
